# Fluent-VBA
Fluent VBA is a fluent unit testing framework for VBA. This project was inspired by [Fluent Assertions](https://fluentassertions.com/).

Fluent frameworks are intended to be read like natural language. So instead of having something like:

    Option Explicit

    Sub NormalUnitTestExample
        Dim result as long
        Dim Assert as cUnitTester
        
        '//Arrange
        Set Assert = New cUnitTester
        
        '//Act
        result = returnVal(5) â€˜returns the value provided as an argument
        
        '//Assert
        Assert.Equal(Result,5)
    End Sub
    
    Public Function returnVal(value As Variant)
        returnVal = value
    End Function
 
You can have code that reads more naturally like so:

    Option Explicit

    Sub FluentUnitTestExample1
        Dim Result As cFluent
        Dim returnedResult As Variant
        
        '//arrange
        Set Result = New cFluent
        returnedResult = returnVal(5)
        
        '//Act
        Result.TestValue = returnedResult
        
        '//Assert
        Debug.Assert Result.Should.Be.EqualTo(5)
    End Sub

Or, arguably, even more naturally using cFluentOf objects like this:

    Option Explicit

    Sub FluentUnitTestExample2()
        Dim Result As cFluentOf
        Dim returnedResult As Variant
        
        '//arrange
        Set Result = New cFluentOf
        returnedResult = returnVal(5)
        
        '//Act
        With Result.Of(returnedResult)
            '//Assert
            Debug.Assert .Should.Be.EqualTo(5)
        End With
    End Sub
    
Or like this:

    Option Explicit

    Sub FluentUnitTestExample3()
        Dim Result As cFluentOf
        Dim returnedResult As Variant
        
        '//arrange
        Set Result = New cFluentOf
        returnedResult = returnVal(5)
        
        '//Act & Assert
        Debug.Assert Result.Of(returnedResult).Should.Be.EqualTo(5)
    End Sub

# Testing notes

All of the tests are written in the mTests.bas module. There are nearly 150 tests within this file. The tests use a combination of cFluent and cFluentOf objects to test the framework. You can see more information regarding the testing notes [here](https://github.com/b-gonzalez/Fluent-VBA/wiki/Testing-notes)

# Using Fluent VBA in an external project

All of the class modules in Fluent VBA are PublicNotCreatable. So the project can be used as a reference in other projects. If you plan on doing this I'd recommend doing the following:

1. Create a testing file that will reference the Fluent VBA workbook and the file containing the code to be tested
2. In the VBA projects references for the testing file, reference both the Fluent VBA workbook and the file containing the code to be tested.
3. Create a testing procedure that has a variable that has the type of IFluent or IFluentOf.
4. Instantiate this variable using the MakeFluent function or the MakeFluentOf function for IFluent or IFluentOf types respectively.
5. Write your tests.

# TODO: High level API design overview

I'd like to write a high-level overview of the API's design. This had been completed previously but is now outdated. You can find a post of mine describing an older version of the API's structure on CodeReview on StackExchange [here](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/267836/a-fluent-unit-testing-framework-in-vba). I will likely be updating this within the coming weeks.

# Contacting me

You can contact me at b.gonzalez.programming@gmail.com. Feel free to contact me regarding bug fixes, contributions (see more below), or other topics.

# Contributing to Fluent VBA

I'm open to external contributions for Fluent VBA. I do need to work on a style guide to determine how I'd like such contributions to be implemented. I also expect any contributions to have unit tests using the Fluent VBA framework.

# Feature requests

You are free to contact me regarding feature requests as long as you understand that I'm not obligated to implement them. I expect messages to be polite, respectful, and without a sense of entitlement. As long as you do those things, I'm happy to hear what you have to say.

# Final notes

The API is in a good and usable state. Overall I'm pretty happy with the API's internal and external design. As of right now, I only anticipate internal changes and feature enhancements. So the design of the API should be relatively stable. I'd be open to changing certain design aspects of the API if I found a good reason to do so however. Naturally, this is dependant on time and availability on my part however.
